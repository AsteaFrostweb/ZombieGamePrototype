# Zombie Game Prototype
This projects main purpose is to prototype some ideas and get compfortable with some unity features before starting work on the full Zombie Game project.

# Some of the things I hope to learn from this project
    -How to use Unity's animation system
    -How to import and use "Mixamo" animations
    -How to handle shooter game mechanics
    -How to handle simple building mechanics

# Some of the features I hope will be in the full game are:
    -Simple building system requiring materials
    -Zombie's that chase player
    -Multiple weapons (Melee/Firearms)
    -Tools for gathering materials
